# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Apple-Stock-Price-Data

**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict Apple's stock prices for 2024 using time series analysis techniques. By leveraging historical stock data, advanced statistical models like ARIMA and machine learning methods are employed to forecast future prices. The project includes data preprocessing, stationarity testing, model fitting, and evaluation, with the goal of providing accurate predictions to assist investors in making informed decisions.

**Objective**
Analyze historical Apple stock price data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality.
Test for stationarity and apply appropriate time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA.
Develop and evaluate forecasting models using metrics like RMSE.
Visualize the stock price trends, predicted values, and residuals to assess model performance.

**Techniques Used**
ARIMA & SARIMA Models: To model the time series data and forecast future stock prices.
Stationarity Tests: ADF and KPSS tests to ensure data stability before modeling.
Decomposition: Seasonal decomposition to extract trend, seasonal, and residual components.
Model Evaluation: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for assessing model accuracy.

**Data Used**
Apple stock price data from a publicly available source (e.g., Yahoo Finance) covering multiple years up to 2023.
Features used include the daily closing prices of Apple stock.

**Results**
The project produced a reliable time series model capable of predicting Apple's stock price for 2024.
Predictions showed significant accuracy with an RMSE of 2.59, which is a strong result for stock price forecasting.
